# Fika Map

Fika Map uses machine learning to transform access and alleviate poverty in rural, low-income communities.

Rural communities experience outsized negative effects when the lack of basic infrastructure means they can’t reach important destinations. We’ve developed Fika Map, a suite of remote analysis tools, to locate where access is most beneficial via the power of machine learning. The result? More scalable, impactful rural access solutions around the world.
